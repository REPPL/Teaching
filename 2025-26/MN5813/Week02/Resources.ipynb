    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organises code into [objects](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/), which are instances of [classes](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/). This approach helps in structuring code in a way that's often more intuitive and closer to how we think about real-world entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduction covers the basics, but OOP has many more advanced concepts and techniques that you can explore once you're familar with these basic concepts."

   "source": "### Key concepts\n\n1. **Classes**: Blueprints for creating objects. They define the attributes (**data**) and methods (**functions**) that the objects will have.\n2. **Objects**: Instances of classes. They represent specific entities with their own set of data.\n3. **Attributes**: Data stored inside an object. In other words, attributes are characteristics (**properties**) of an object _(e.g., account balance, account holder's name, etc.)_.\n4. **Methods**: Functions associated with a class that can perform actions or computations. In other words, methods are like actions (**behaviours**) that an object can perform _(e.g., to deposit money, to withdraw money, etc.)_."

    "### Key terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation**: Data and methods are bundled together, hiding the internal details of how the object works. One benefit of using encapsulation is that it protects the data inside an object and only allows access to it through defined methods.\n",
    "2. **Reusability**: Once a class is defined, we can create as many instances (objects) as we need.\n",
    "3. **Modularity**: Classes can be defined and maintained independently, making code more organised.\n",
    "5. **Inheritance**: New classes can be created based on existing classes, inheriting their attributes and methods. _(See illustration below.)_\n",
    "6. **Polymorphism**: The ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call, each in its own way. _(This goes way beyond this introduction!)_"

The `SavingsAccount` class inherits from `BankAccount`, adding its own specific attribute _(`interest_rate`)_ and method _(`apply_interest()`)_.
