# Week 02 Data Files

This directory contains sample datasets for Week 02 (Advanced Python).

## Important Note on File Organisation

**Note**: The notebooks in Week 02 currently reference data files in the parent `assets/` directory, not in this `assets/data/` subdirectory. The files in this directory appear to be duplicates and are not actively used by the teaching materials. Consider consolidating all data files into this `assets/data/` directory and updating notebook paths for consistency with other weeks.

## example.txt

### Purpose

A simple text file used to demonstrate file writing, reading, and appending operations.

### Dataset Structure

**Format**: Plain text
**Size**: ~86 bytes
**Content**: Multiple sentences concatenated without line breaks

### Content

```
Hello, World!This is a test file.Python file I/O is easy to use.This line is appended.
```

### Usage in Week 02

Used to demonstrate:
1. Writing text to files
2. Reading file contents
3. Appending data to existing files
4. File modes (`'w'`, `'r'`, `'a'`)

## stock_prices_input.csv

### Purpose

Sample stock price data in CSV format for demonstrating CSV file reading and processing.

### Dataset Structure

**Format**: CSV (Comma-separated values)
**Size**: 3 data rows + 1 header row
**Columns**: 2 (`date`, `price`)

### Content Structure

| Column | Type | Description | Sample Values |
|--------|------|-------------|---------------|
| `date` | String | Date in YYYY-MM-DD format | 2023-01-01 to 2023-01-03 |
| `price` | Float | Stock price in currency units | 99.80 to 101.75 |

### Sample Data

```csv
date,price
2023-01-01,100.50
2023-01-02,101.75
2023-01-03,99.80
```

### Usage in Week 02

Used to demonstrate:
1. Reading CSV files with the `csv` module
2. Processing tabular data
3. Writing CSV files with calculated values
4. Working with headers and data rows
5. Type conversion (string to float)

**Note**: Notebooks reference `assets/stock_prices_input.csv` (not `assets/data/stock_prices_input.csv`)

## students_input.json

### Purpose

Student score data in JSON format for demonstrating JSON file reading and manipulation.

### Dataset Structure

**Format**: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
**Size**: 3 student records
**Structure**: Array of objects with name and scores

### Content Structure

```json
[
  {"name": "Alice", "scores": [85, 90, 92]},
  {"name": "Bob", "scores": [78, 85, 88]},
  {"name": "Carol", "scores": [92, 95, 98]}
]
```

Each student record contains:
- `name` (String): Student's first name
- `scores` (Array of Integers): List of 3 test scores

### Data Characteristics

- **Students**: 3 records
- **Scores per student**: 3 values
- **Score range**: 78-98
- **Average scores**: Alice (89.0), Bob (83.7), Carol (95.0)

### Usage in Week 02

Used to demonstrate:
1. Reading JSON files with the `json` module
2. Parsing JSON data structures (lists and dictionaries)
3. Calculating statistics (average scores)
4. Writing modified JSON data to output files
5. Working with nested data structures

**Note**: Notebooks reference `assets/students_input.json` (not `assets/data/students_input.json`)

## Output Files

The Week 02 exercises and solutions create additional output files in the `assets/` directory:

- `stock_prices_output.csv` - CSV with calculated price changes
- `students_output.json` - JSON with calculated average scores
- `output/my_output.txt` - Text file outputs in separate output directory

## Expected Learning Outcomes

Students working with these files should be able to:
- Work with different file formats (TXT, CSV, JSON)
- Use appropriate Python modules (`csv`, `json`)
- Read and write structured data
- Process and transform data between formats
- Calculate basic statistics on data
- Handle file paths and organise output files

## Data Organisation Recommendations

**Current structure** (inconsistent):
```
Week02/
├── assets/
│   ├── stock_prices_input.csv          ← Used by notebooks
│   ├── stock_prices_output.csv         ← Generated by notebooks
│   ├── students_input.json             ← Used by notebooks
│   ├── students_output.json            ← Generated by notebooks
│   └── data/
│       ├── example.txt                  ← Not used by notebooks
│       ├── stock_prices_input.csv       ← Duplicate, not used
│       └── students_input.json          ← Duplicate, not used
└── output/
    └── my_output.txt                    ← Generated output
```

**Recommended structure** (consistent with other weeks):
```
Week02/
├── assets/
│   ├── data/                            ← All input data files
│   │   ├── example.txt
│   │   ├── stock_prices_input.csv
│   │   └── students_input.json
│   └── output/                          ← All generated outputs
│       ├── stock_prices_output.csv
│       ├── students_output.json
│       └── my_output.txt
```
