# Week 02: Advanced Python

*Building on `Week01` to explore more advanced Python programming concepts and techniques.*

## Contents

- **[Introduction.ipynb](./Introduction.ipynb)**: Overview of week's objectives and key concepts
- **[Demonstration.ipynb](./Demonstration.ipynb)**: Examples of advanced Python features
- **[Exercises.ipynb](./Exercises.ipynb)**: Practice problems focusing on functional programming and error handling
- **[Solutions.ipynb](./Solutions.ipynb)**: Complete solutions with detailed explanations
- **[Resources.ipynb](./Resources.ipynb)**: Additional learning resources and references
- **assets/data/**: Sample data files for exercises
  - `example.txt`: Text file for file I/O exercises
  - `stock_prices_input.csv`: CSV data for file processing (generated by notebooks)
  - `students_input.json`: JSON data for parsing exercises (generated by notebooks)
- **assets/figure/**: Diagrams and visual aids
  - `oop-concepts-diagram.svg`: Object-oriented programming concepts visualisation

Start with the `Introduction` notebook for an overview, then work through the `Demonstration` to see concepts in action, complete the `Exercises` independently, and check your work against the `Solutions`.

## Topics covered

1. **List comprehensions**
   - Syntax and structure
   - Filtering with conditions
   - Nested comprehensions

2. **Functional programming**
   - Lambda functions
   - Map, filter, and reduce
   - Higher-order functions

3. **Error handling**
   - try-except blocks
   - Exception types
   - Custom error messages

4. **File I/O operations**
   - Reading and writing text files
   - Working with CSV files
   - JSON data processing

## Time commitment

**Note**: This module uses 60-minute lecture slots and 2-hour workshop slots. The timings below show how content fits within these sessions, allowing time for discussion and questions.

- **Introduction**: 20-30 minutes (presented in 45-minute lecture, which fits comfortably in the 60-minute slot)
- **Demonstration**: 60-75 minutes (self-study notebook, work through before workshop)
  - Core content: Essential techniques for exercises
  - Supplementary content: Optional deeper exploration
  - Run code cells, experiment with examples, take notes
- **Workshop exercises**: 90 minutes (hands-on practice with instructor support, fits comfortably in the 2-hour workshop slot)
- **Solutions review**: 30 minutes (after completing exercises)

**Session structure**:
- Lecture: 45 minutes (introduces Week 03 assessment structure)
- Workshop: 105 minutes (includes setup time and early departure)

**Total self-study**: Approximately 3-3.5 hours per week

## Recommended workflow

1. **Attend lecture** (45 min) - Conceptual introduction to Week 03 assessment overview
2. **Work through Demonstration** (60-75 min) - Before workshop (optional but strongly recommended)
   - Run all code cells in sequence
   - Experiment with modifying examples
   - Take notes on techniques you'll use in exercises
3. **Attend workshop** (105 min) - Practice exercises with instructor support
4. **Review solutions** (30 min) - Compare your approach after workshop

## Key learning objectives

By the end of this week's session, you should be able to:

- Write efficient code using list comprehensions
- Apply functional programming concepts to solve problems
- Handle errors gracefully in your programmes
- Read from and write to various file formats
