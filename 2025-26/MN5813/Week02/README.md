# Advanced Python

*Building on `Week01` to explore more advanced Python programming concepts and techniques.*

## Contents

- **[Introduction.ipynb](./Introduction.ipynb)**: Overview of week's objectives and key concepts
- **[Demonstration.ipynb](./Demonstration.ipynb)**: Examples of advanced Python features
- **[Exercises.ipynb](./Exercises.ipynb)**: Practice problems focusing on functional programming and error handling
- **[Solutions.ipynb](./Solutions.ipynb)**: Complete solutions with detailed explanations
- **[Resources.ipynb](./Resources.ipynb)**: Additional learning resources and references
- **assets/example_data/**: Sample data files for exercises
  - `example.txt`: Text file for file I/O exercises
  - `stock_prices_input.csv`: CSV data for file processing
  - `students_input.json`: JSON data for parsing exercises
- **assets/figure/**: Diagrams and visual aids
  - `oop-concepts-diagram.svg`: Object-oriented programming concepts visualisation

Start with the `Introduction` notebook for an overview, then work through the `Demonstration` to see concepts in action, complete the `Exercises` independently, and check your work against the `Solutions`.

## Topics covered

1. **List comprehensions**
   - Syntax and structure
   - Filtering with conditions
   - Nested comprehensions

2. **Functional programming**
   - Lambda functions
   - Map, filter, and reduce
   - Higher-order functions

3. **Error handling**
   - try-except blocks
   - Exception types
   - Custom error messages

4. **File I/O operations**
   - Reading and writing text files
   - Working with CSV files
   - JSON data processing

## Key learning objectives

By the end of this week's session, you should be able to:

- Write efficient code using list comprehensions
- Apply functional programming concepts to solve problems
- Handle errors gracefully in your programmes
- Read from and write to various file formats
