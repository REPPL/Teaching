    "By the end of this week, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create complex time series visualisations** - plot multiple series with dual axes\n",
    "2. **Design small multiples** - use `FacetGrid` for comparative analysis\n",
    "3. **Build interactive visualisations** - create dynamic plots with hvPlot\n",
    "4. **Apply advanced Seaborn techniques** - use `PairGrid` and complex statistical plots\n",
    "5. **Design effective dashboards** - combine multiple visualisations in a meaningful way\n",
    "6. **Optimise for large datasets** - sometimes, performance matters!"

    "- Overlaying trend lines and confidence intervals\n",
