An individual `analytics report` _(80%)_\n\nThe rationale is that the artefact _(i.e., `group report`)_ prepares you for -- and forms the foundation of -- the individual `analytics report`. While you will be given a dataset for the `group report`, you can choose any dataset for your individual `analytics report`. _(A template for your deliverable is available on the GitHub page for this module, which you can adapt to suit either part of the assessment.)_\n\nNote: This Jupyter Notebook was originally compiled by Alex Reppel (AR) based on conversations with [ClaudeAI](https://claude.ai/) *(version 3.5 Sonnet)*. For this year's materials, further revisions were made using [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) *(Sonnet 4.5)*, including updated documentation and git commit messages."

    "- Load the `athlete_events.csv` file into a Pandas `DataFrame`\n",
    "  - **Basic requirement:** Download the `.csv` file and load it into Pandas\n",
    "  - **Stretch goal:** e.g., load the file from a remote source, e.g., GitHub, etc. _OR_ convert `.csv` file into `.json` and load the `.json` file directly into Pandas\n",
    "  - **Super stretch goal:** e.g., create an HTML table from the data and load the data directly from the remote webpage\n",
    "- Display the first few rows and basic information about the `DataFrame`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handle missing values in the dataset _(i.e., check whether missing values -- `NaN` -- exist in the dataset and deal with them appropriately as we discussed in class)_\n",
    "- Convert data types where necessary *(e.g., ensure `Year` is in datetime format)*\n",
    "- Remove any duplicate entries _(if they exist)_\n",

    "_(There are perhaps fewer opportunities around data cleaning to go beyond essential requirements.)_\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data wrangling\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Calculate the `average age` of athletes for each Olympic event\n",
    "- Determine the top 10 countries with the most gold medals\n",
    "- Find the athlete with the most medals in each sport\n",
    "\n",
    "_(This is one of the two main categories where I think you can stretch yourselves; ideally, you will discuss options in your group first, without thinking about whether you know how to actually do it yet. Also, I suggest that you conduct a brief 'ideation' exercise, similar to what we did in class in preparation for this group assignment -- using pens and post-it notes, etc.)_\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data visualisation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create at least two meaningful visualisations using the cleaned and wrangled data\n",
    "  - **Basic requirement:** Create two basic -- but meaningful -- visualisations representing the outcome of your data analysis; you will draw on the `matplotlib` library and most likely use standard forms of data visualisation, such as bar charts, etc. _(Top tip: Avoid pie charts!)_\n",
    "  - **Stretch goal:** e.g., use a different library, such as [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), and/or more sophisticated visualisations that plot data across three dimensions\n",
    "  - **Super stretch goal:** e.g., create carefully formatted visualisations, which typically requires much more thought and also requires you to familiarise yourself with the configuration options of the library you are using; my personal favourite remain [small multiples](https://github.com/REPPL/Using-small-multiples-to-visualise-the-effect-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic), which are not easy to implement\n",
    "- Provide a brief interpretation of each visualisation\n",
    "\n",
    "_(This category is the other one I think you can stretch yourselves; it is deliberately kept vague to give you room to interpret requirements, as you will have to convince your reader that your visualisations are indeed 'meaningful'. This is the category I expect every team to stretch themselves beyond essential requirements; either by creating somewhat more sophisticated visualisations, and/or by providing more in-depth/extensive interpretations of what is shown in those visualisations.)_\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Export results\n",
    "\n",
    "- Save the cleaned and wrangled `DataFrame` to a new `.csv` file\n",
    "- Export the visualisations as image files *(e.g., PDF, PNG, etc.)*"

    "  - for data/statistics, you must provide a reference to the source of that data _(i.e., your reader must have access to the original source of that data/statistics)_\n",
    "  - for tools & techniques, you must cite the source(s) you have drawn on to learn them, such as, in the case of [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), you may wish to consider the very accessible book \"[Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/)\" _(but only if you use it -- if you draw on the Pandas [user guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html), for example, it's sufficient to link to them rather than to use in-text citations)_\n",

You can think of the aim as providing the general direction, while objectives can be seen as milestones that get you there. An excellent source helping you formulate an aim and set of objectives for your project is John Bowden's book \"[Writing a Report : How to Prepare, Write and Present Really Effective Reports](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.royalholloway.idm.oclc.org/lib/rhul/detail.action?docID=471307)\" available through the library.\n",

One example could be to draw on the academic literature to position your project _(vis-a-vis other studies related to the topic, etc.)_ and/or to draw on techniques of analysis that you will be following.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider, for example, the paper \"[Measuring the performance of nations at the Summer Olympics using data envelopment analysis](https://doi.org/10.1057/palgrave.jors.2601327)\" -- the authors compare the population and GNP of nations with the number of Olympic medals won _(i.e., gold, silver, bronze)_. Perhaps you wish to conduct a similar analysis as a _super stretch goal_ for your group report?\n",
