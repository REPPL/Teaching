# Assessment

*Introducing the module assessment structure and requirements.*

## Contents

- **[Introduction.ipynb](./Introduction.ipynb)**: Comprehensive overview of assessment requirements and marking criteria
- **[Template.ipynb](./Template.ipynb)**: Starter template for the individual analytics report

## Assessment structure

### Part 1: Group Report (20%)
- Collaborative analysis of Olympics dataset
- Focus on data loading, cleaning, wrangling, and visualisation
- Group presentation of findings

### Part 2: Individual Analytics Report (80%)
- Independent project using student-selected dataset
- Comprehensive data analysis pipeline
- Deliverables include:
  - Jupyter notebook with complete analysis
  - Executive summary
  - Technical documentation

## Key requirements

**Data loading and cleaning**

- Handle missing values
- Address data quality issues
- Document cleaning decisions

**Data wrangling**

- Transform data for analysis
- Create derived features
- Prepare data for visualisation

**Analysis and insights**

- Apply appropriate statistical methods
- Generate business insights
- Support conclusions with evidence

**Visualisation**

- Create clear, informative charts
- Use appropriate visualisation types
- Follow best practices for data presentation

## Time commitment

**Note**: Week 03 is an assessment overview week, not a teaching week. This session introduces the two assessments (group report and individual report) that you'll complete throughout the module.

- **Introduction**: 45-60 minutes (detailed review of assessment requirements and marking criteria)
- **Template review**: 15-30 minutes (understanding the notebook structure for your individual report)
- **Q&A session**: 15-30 minutes (clarifying requirements and expectations)

**Session structure**:
- Lecture/Workshop combined: 90 minutes (assessment briefing and Q&A)

**Total in-session**: Approximately 1.5 hours

**Note**: The actual assessment work (group project in Week 06, individual report starting in December) requires substantial time outside of scheduled sessions. Plan your time accordingly and start early.

## Important notes

- Review the marking criteria carefully in the Introduction notebook
- Use the Template notebook as a starting point for your individual report
- Both assessments require demonstration of Python programming skills learned throughout the module
