# Introduction to Python

*Building on Setup week to explore Python fundamentals for business analytics.*

## Contents

- **[Introduction.ipynb](./Introduction.ipynb)**: Overview of week's objectives and key concepts
- **[Demonstration.ipynb](./Demonstration.ipynb)**: Examples covering basic Python concepts
- **[Exercises.ipynb](./Exercises.ipynb)**: Practice problems (2 hours)
- **[Solutions.ipynb](./Solutions.ipynb)**: Complete solutions with explanations
- **assets/data/**: Sample data files for exercises
  - `sales_data.txt`: Sales data for file I/O exercises

Start with the `Introduction` notebook for an overview, then work through the `Demonstration` to see concepts in action, complete the `Exercises` independently, and check your work against the `Solutions`.

## Topics covered

1. **Variables and data types**
   - Basic arithmetic operations
   - Variable assignment and naming conventions
   - Data types: integers, floats, strings, booleans

2. **String manipulation**
   - String methods (strip, split, lower, upper)
   - String slicing and indexing
   - Formatting strings

3. **Control flow**
   - if-elif-else statements
   - Comparison operators
   - Boolean logic

4. **Loops**
   - for loops
   - while loops
   - Loop control statements

5. **Functions**
   - Function definition and calling
   - Parameters and return values
   - Scope and return statements

6. **Lists and dictionaries**
   - List operations and methods
   - List slicing and indexing
   - Dictionaries and key-value pairs
   - Accessing and modifying values

7. **File handling**
   - Reading from text files
   - Writing to text files
   - Using with statements

## Time commitment

**Note**: This module uses 60-minute lecture slots and 2-hour workshop slots. The timings below show how content fits within these sessions, allowing time for discussion and questions.

- **Introduction**: 20-30 minutes (presented in 45-minute lecture, which fits comfortably in the 60-minute slot)
- **Demonstration**: 60-75 minutes (self-study notebook, work through before workshop)
  - Core content: Essential techniques for exercises
  - Supplementary content: Optional deeper exploration
  - Run code cells, experiment with examples, take notes
- **Workshop exercises**: 90 minutes (hands-on practice with instructor support, fits comfortably in the 2-hour workshop slot)
- **Solutions review**: 30 minutes (after completing exercises)

**Session structure**:
- Lecture: 45 minutes (introduces Week 02 content)
- Workshop: 105 minutes (includes setup time and early departure)

**Total self-study**: Approximately 3-3.5 hours per week

## Recommended workflow

1. **Attend lecture** (45 min) - Conceptual introduction to Week 02 topics
2. **Work through Demonstration** (60-75 min) - Before workshop (optional but strongly recommended)
   - Run all code cells in sequence
   - Experiment with modifying examples
   - Take notes on techniques you'll use in exercises
3. **Attend workshop** (105 min) - Practice exercises with instructor support
4. **Review solutions** (30 min) - Compare your approach after workshop

## Key learning objectives

By the end of this week's session, you should be able to:

- Work confidently with different data types
- Write more complex functions with multiple parameters
- Use string methods effectively for text processing
- Master list operations for data manipulation
- Create and manipulate dictionaries for structured data
- Handle basic file operations for data persistence
