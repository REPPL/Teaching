# Introduction to Python

*Building on Setup week to explore Python fundamentals for business analytics.*

## Contents

- **[Introduction.ipynb](./Introduction.ipynb)**: Overview of week's objectives and key concepts
- **[Demonstration.ipynb](./Demonstration.ipynb)**: Examples covering basic Python concepts
- **[Exercises.ipynb](./Exercises.ipynb)**: Practice problems (2 hours)
- **[Solutions.ipynb](./Solutions.ipynb)**: Complete solutions with explanations
- **assets/data/**: Sample data files for exercises
  - `sales_data.txt`: Sales data for file I/O exercises

Start with the `Introduction` notebook for an overview, then work through the `Demonstration` to see concepts in action, complete the `Exercises` independently, and check your work against the `Solutions`.

   - String slicing and indexing
   - Formatting strings

3. **Control flow**
   - if-elif-else statements
   - Comparison operators
   - Boolean logic

4. **Loops**
   - for loops
   - while loops
   - Loop control statements

5. **Functions**
   - Function definition and calling
   - Parameters and return values
   - Scope and return statements

6. **Lists and dictionaries**
   - List operations and methods
   - List slicing and indexing
   - Dictionaries and key-value pairs
   - Accessing and modifying values

7. **File handling**
   - Reading from text files
