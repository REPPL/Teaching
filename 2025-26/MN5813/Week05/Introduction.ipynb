    "The concept of \"tidy data\" was introduced by statistician Hadley Wickham. Tidy data follows three principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Each variable forms a column** – Every column represents a single attribute\n",
    "2. **Each observation forms a row** – Every row represents a single measurement or record\n",
    "3. **Each type of observational unit forms a table** – Related data is organised in a single DataFrame\n",
