Exercises are designed to be completed in approximately 90 minutes by students who have little familiarity with the topics._\n\nNote: This Jupyter Notebook was originally compiled by Alex Reppel (AR) based on conversations with [ClaudeAI](https://claude.ai/) *(version 3.5 Sonnet)*. For this year's materials, further revisions were made using [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) *(Sonnet 4.5)*, including updated documentation and git commit messages."
