# Week 07: Introduction to Data Visualisation

*This week introduces data visualisation, essential for understanding patterns in data and communicating insights effectively.*

## Contents

- **[Introduction.ipynb](./Introduction.ipynb)**: Overview of week's objectives and key concepts
- **[Demonstration.ipynb](./Demonstration.ipynb)**: Comprehensive introduction to visualisation concepts and techniques
- **[Exercises.ipynb](./Exercises.ipynb)**: Hands-on practice with plotting and customisation
- **[Solutions.ipynb](./Solutions.ipynb)**: Complete solutions with explanations
- **assets/data/**: Sample datasets for exercises
  - Datasets generated within notebooks for demonstration purposes
- **assets/figure/week07/**: Visual learning aids
  - `figure.png`: Example figure output

Start with the `Introduction` notebook for an overview, then work through the `Demonstration` to see concepts in action, complete the `Exercises` independently, and check your work against the `Solutions`.

## Topics

**Choosing visualisation types**

- Line plots for trends over time
- Bar charts for comparing categories
- Scatter plots for relationships
- Histograms and box plots for distributions
- When to use each chart type

**Pandas plotting**

- Quick plots with `.plot()` method
- Chart type parameters
- Basic customisation options

**Matplotlib fundamentals**

- `Figure` and `axes` objects
- Customising `title`s, `label`s, `colour`s
- Controlling `legend`s and `grid`s
- `Subplot` arrangements

**Seaborn statistical plots**

- Distribution visualisations
- Relationship plots
- Categorical plots
- Statistical annotations

**Best practices**

- Clear, informative labels
- Accessible colour schemes
- Professional styling
- Avoiding common mistakes

## Learning outcomes

After this week, you'll be able to:

- Select appropriate visualisation types for different data and messages
- Create quick exploratory plots with Pandas
- Customise plots professionally with Matplotlib
- Use Seaborn for statistical visualisations
- Apply design best practices for clarity and accessibility

## Time commitment

**Note**: This module uses 60-minute lecture slots and 2-hour workshop slots. The timings below show how content fits within these sessions, allowing time for discussion and questions.

- **Introduction**: 20-30 minutes (presented in 45-minute lecture, which fits comfortably in the 60-minute slot)
- **Demonstration**: 60-75 minutes (self-study notebook, work through before workshop)
  - Core content: Essential plotting techniques for exercises
  - Supplementary content: Best practices and design principles
  - Run code cells, experiment with examples, take notes
- **Workshop exercises**: 90 minutes (hands-on practice with instructor support, fits comfortably in the 2-hour workshop slot)
- **Solutions review**: 30 minutes (after completing exercises)

**Session structure**:
- Lecture: 45 minutes (introduces next week's content)
- Workshop: 105 minutes (includes setup time and early departure)

*(Total self-study: Approximately 3-3.5 hours per week.)*

## Recommended workflow

1. **Attend lecture** (45 min) - Conceptual introduction to next week's topics
2. **Work through Demonstration** (60-75 min) - Before workshop (optional but strongly recommended)
   - Run all code cells in sequence
   - Experiment with modifying examples
   - Try different chart types and customisations
3. **Attend workshop** (105 min) - Practice exercises with instructor support
4. **Review solutions** (30 min) - Compare your approach after workshop

## Prerequisites

Before starting Week 07, you should be comfortable with:
- **Weeks 04-05**: Pandas DataFrames for data preparation and manipulation
- **Week 06**: Group project work provides context for visualising analytical findings

## Connection to your project

Visualisation is essential for:
- Exploring your individual project dataset
- Identifying patterns and outliers
- Communicating findings in your report
- Creating publication-quality figures
- Supporting your analytical narrative

Your individual report must include clear, professional (!!) visualisations that enhance understanding of your findings.
