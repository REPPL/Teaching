# Setup: Installation & Python basics

*Prepare your environment and learn Python foundations before Week 01*

## Overview

This setup week is designed to get you ready for MN5813. You'll install the necessary software, understand the module structure, and learn Python basics if you're new to programming.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this setup week, you will:
1. Understand the module structure and available resources
2. Have Anaconda installed and working on your computer
3. Generate the example datasets used throughout the module
4. Understand basic Python concepts (variables, functions, loops, etc.)

## Contents

### Notebooks
- **[Introduction.ipynb](./Introduction.ipynb)**: Module overview, learning resources, and guidance on generative AI
- **[Installation.ipynb](./Installation.ipynb)**: Step-by-step Anaconda installation and data generation
- **[Demonstration.ipynb](./Demonstration.ipynb)**: Python basics for non-programmers

### Data
- **data/synthetic_data/**: Example datasets for exercises
  - `business_metrics.csv`: 200-day business performance dataset
  - `retail_sales.csv`: 5,000 retail transactions dataset
- **[data/README.md](./data/README.md)**: Dataset documentation

## Recommended pathway

### Day 1: Orientation (30 minutes)
1. Open [`Introduction.ipynb`](./Introduction.ipynb)
2. Review module structure and expectations
3. Explore available learning resources
4. Understand generative AI guidelines

### Day 2: Installation (45 minutes)
1. Open [`Installation.ipynb`](./Installation.ipynb)
2. Install Anaconda following the step-by-step guide
3. Verify your installation
4. Generate the example datasets

### Day 3-4: Python Basics (2-3 hours)
1. Open [`Demonstration.ipynb`](./Demonstration.ipynb)
2. Work through each section carefully
3. Run all code examples
4. Complete the practice exercises
5. Don't rush - understanding these basics is crucial

## Important notes for beginners

### If you're new to programming:
- **Don't skip the Python basics** in Demonstration.ipynb
- **Take your time** - rushing through won't help
- **Run every code example** to see what happens
- **Make mistakes** - they're part of learning
- **Ask questions** when stuck

### If you have programming experience:
- You can skim through Demonstration.ipynb quickly
- Focus on Python-specific syntax if coming from another language
- The datasets have intentional data quality issues for learning purposes

## Data quality note

The datasets in `data/synthetic_data/` contain realistic data quality issues:
- Missing values
- Outliers
- Data entry errors
- Duplicate records

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Real-world data is messy! You'll spend significant time cleaning data in practice. Explore the datasets thoroughly before checking the documentation for known issues.

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues:
- **Anaconda won't install**: Check system requirements and permissions
- **Import errors**: Ensure you're using the Anaconda environment
- **Code doesn't run**: Check for typos and indentation
- **Different output**: Random data generation may vary

### Getting help:
1. Review the error message carefully
2. Check the relevant notebook section
3. Search for the error online
4. Ask during Week 01's session

## Ready checklist

Before Week 01, ensure you can:
- [ ] Open Jupyter notebooks
- [ ] Run Python code cells
- [ ] Create variables and perform calculations
- [ ] Write simple if statements and loops
- [ ] Define and use basic functions
- [ ] Access the example datasets

If you can do all of these, you're ready to begin Week 01!
