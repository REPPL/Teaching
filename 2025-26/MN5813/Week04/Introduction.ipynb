Think of it as a **cross between a Python list and a dictionary** - it has the ordered nature of a list but with labels (called an index) for each element. `Series` are the building blocks of `DataFrame`s; each column in a `DataFrame` is essentially a `Series`.\n",

You can think of it as a spreadsheet, or a dictionary of `Series` objects. `DataFrames` are incredibly versatile and allow you to store and manipulate tabular data with rows and columns. Each column is a `Series`, and operations can be performed on entire columns, rows, or individual cells.\n",

    "Filtering and selection are fundamental operations in data analysis that allow you to focus on specific subsets of your data. In Pandas, you can select data using column names, row indices, or boolean conditions. Boolean indexing (shown below) is particularly powerful - you create a condition that returns `True` or `False` for each row, and Pandas returns only the rows where the condition is `True`.\n",

    "### 4. Grouping and aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "`GroupBy` operations follow a \"split-apply-combine\" pattern: split your data into groups based on some criteria, apply a function to each group independently, and combine the results back into a data structure. This is essential for answering questions like *\"What's the average sale per region?\"* or *\"How many products were sold by category?\"* The `groupby()` method is one of the most powerful features in Pandas, enabling you to perform complex aggregations with simple, readable code.\n",
