# Week 04: Introduction to Pandas

*This week introduces Pandas, the fundamental library for data analysis in Python.*

## Contents

- **[Introduction.ipynb](./Introduction.ipynb)**: Overview of week's objectives and key concepts
- **[Demonstration.ipynb](./Demonstration.ipynb)**: Comprehensive introduction to Pandas concepts and operations
- **[Exercises.ipynb](./Exercises.ipynb)**: Hands-on practice with DataFrames and Series
- **[Solutions.ipynb](./Solutions.ipynb)**: Complete solutions with explanations
- **assets/data/**: Sample datasets for exercises
  - `people.csv`: Simple demographic data (generated by notebooks)
  - `people_with_salary.csv`: Extended demographic data (generated by notebooks)
  - `data.csv`: CSV format example
  - `data.json`: JSON format example
  - `data.xlsx`: Excel format example
- **assets/figure/**: Visual learning aids
  - `pandas-joins-diagram.svg`: Visualisation of DataFrame join operations

Start with the `Introduction` notebook for an overview, then work through the `Demonstration` to see concepts in action, complete the `Exercises` independently, and check your work against the `Solutions`.


## Topics

1. **Pandas fundamentals**
   - Series: 1D labeled arrays
   - DataFrames: 2D labeled data structures
   - Indexing and selection

2. **Data input/output**
   - Reading CSV files
   - Writing to various formats
   - Working with Excel and JSON

3. **Basic operations**
   - Filtering and sorting
   - Handling duplicates
   - Basic statistics

4. **Data manipulation**
   - Adding and removing columns
   - Applying functions
   - Conditional operations

5. **Aggregation & grouping**
   - GroupBy operations
   - Aggregate functions
   - Pivot tables

6. **Merging & joining**
   - Different join types
   - Concatenating DataFrames
   - Handling merge conflicts

## Learning outcomes

After this week, you'll be able to:
- Create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames
- Load data from various file formats
- Perform essential data operations
- Combine data from multiple sources
- Generate summary statistics

## Time commitment

**Note**: This module uses 60-minute lecture slots and 2-hour workshop slots. The timings below show how content fits within these sessions, allowing time for discussion and questions.

- **Introduction**: 20-30 minutes (presented in 45-minute lecture, which fits comfortably in the 60-minute slot)
- **Demonstration**: 60-75 minutes (self-study notebook, work through before workshop)
  - Core content: Essential techniques for exercises
  - Supplementary content: Optional deeper exploration
  - Run code cells, experiment with examples, take notes
- **Workshop exercises**: 90 minutes (hands-on practice with instructor support, fits comfortably in the 2-hour workshop slot)
- **Solutions review**: 30 minutes (after completing exercises)

**Session structure**:
- Lecture: 45 minutes (introduces next week's content)
- Workshop: 105 minutes (includes setup time and early departure)

**Total self-study**: Approximately 3-3.5 hours per week

## Recommended workflow

1. **Attend lecture** (45 min) - Conceptual introduction to next week's topics
2. **Work through Demonstration** (60-75 min) - Before workshop (optional but strongly recommended)
   - Run all code cells in sequence
   - Experiment with modifying examples
   - Take notes on techniques you'll use in exercises
3. **Attend workshop** (105 min) - Practice exercises with instructor support
4. **Review solutions** (30 min) - Compare your approach after workshop
