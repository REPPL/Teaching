    "1. **Data loading**: Load athlete_events.csv into a Pandas DataFrame\n",
    "2. **Data cleaning**: Handle missing values, convert data types, remove duplicates\n",

    "4. **Data analysis**: Calculate statistics (average ages, top countries, medal leaders)\n",

    "- **Part 1**: Review basic Pandas on familiar data (Setup week sales data)\n",
    "- **Part 2**: Complete worked example on Olympics-parallel dataset (company sales data)\n",
    "  - Shows basic techniques (Week 04) with full working code\n",
    "  - Suggests advanced extensions (Week 05) for stretch goals\n",

    "### Before the session (individual preparation)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Review Week 04 Demonstration** – refresh basic Pandas operations\n",
    "2. **Review Week 05 Demonstration** – understand data reshaping techniques\n",
    "3. **Read Week 03 Introduction** – understand project requirements clearly\n",
    "4. **Download Olympics dataset** – have athlete_events.csv ready\n",

    "### During the session (group work)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phase 1: Setup (15 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Designate roles**:\n",
    "   - Code writer (shares screen, types code)\n",
    "   - Navigator (guides approach, references Demonstration)\n",
    "   - Documenter (writes explanations in markdown cells)\n",
    "   - Rotate roles throughout session\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Setup project structure**:\n",
    "   - Copy Week03/Template.ipynb\n",
    "   - Add all group members' names and IDs\n",
    "   - Place athlete_events.csv in same directory\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phase 2: Data loading and exploration (20 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the dataset into Pandas\n",
    "2. Use `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()` to explore\n",
    "3. Discuss initial observations as a group\n",
    "4. Reference **Week06 Demonstration Part 2, Section 1** for loading examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phase 3: Data cleaning (30 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify missing values**:\n",
    "   - Use `.isnull().sum()` to count NaN values per column\n",
    "   - Discuss strategy: drop, fill, or leave as-is?\n",
    "   - Document your decisions with markdown explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fix data types**:\n",
    "   - Convert Year to datetime (requirement)\n",
    "   - Check other columns for type issues\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Remove duplicates**:\n",

    "   - Decide on age bands (e.g., 0-18, 19-25, 26-35, 36+)\n",
    "   - Use conditional logic or `pd.cut()`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Full_Name**: Combine name components\n",
    "   - Note: Olympics data has full names already in 'Name' column\n",
    "   - Consider if you need to parse or clean names\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Century**: Extract century from Year\n",
    "   - Calculate from Year column\n",

   "source": "## Common challenges and solutions\n\nBased on previous cohorts, here are challenges you might encounter:\n\n### Challenge 1: Missing values in Medal column\n\n**Issue**: Most athletes don't win medals, so Medal column is mostly NaN\n\n**Solution**: This is expected! For medal counts:\n```python\n# Example code (adapt for your Olympics dataset):\n# df[df['Medal'].notna()].groupby('NOC')['Medal'].count()\n\n# Or count specific medal types:\n# df[df['Medal'] == 'Gold'].groupby('NOC').size()\n```\n\n### Challenge 2: Converting Year to datetime\n\n**Issue**: Year is an integer, not a full date\n\n**Solution**: Create a datetime from year only:\n```python\n# Example code (adapt for your Olympics dataset):\n# df['Year_dt'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Year'], format='%Y')\n```\n\n### Challenge 3: Duplicate athlete entries\n\n**Issue**: Athletes appear multiple times (different events, different years)\n\n**Solution**: This is correct! Each row is an athlete-event combination, not unique athletes. Only remove true duplicates:\n```python\n# Example code (adapt for your Olympics dataset):\n# df.drop_duplicates()  # Removes rows that are identical in ALL columns\n```\n\n### Challenge 4: Team vs Individual sports\n\n**Issue**: In team sports, multiple athletes get the same medal\n\n**Solution**: Decide on your analysis approach and document it:\n- Count medals per athlete (includes team medals)\n- Or count medals per event (one medal = one event win)\n- Explain your choice in your report\n\n### Challenge 5: Historical country name changes\n\n**Issue**: Some NOC codes represent countries that no longer exist (e.g., USSR, East Germany)\n\n**Solution**: \n- Keep historical NOC codes as-is (recommended for basic requirement)\n- Or combine historical/modern codes (good stretch goal)\n- Document your approach\n\n**Reference**: Week06 Demonstration Part 3 discusses these patterns"
